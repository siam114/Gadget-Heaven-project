## List of React Fundamental concepts:
1.**JSX (JavaScript XML)** :  Using HTML-like syntax within JavaScript to define the structure of UI components.  
2.**Components** : Reusable building blocks for UI, structured as functional or class components.  
3.**Props** : Passing data from parent to child components 
4.**State Management** : Managing local component states to track and respond to user inputs and data changes.
5.**Hooks** : Leveraging React hooks like useState, useEffect, useContext, and custom hooks for managing state, side effects, and context.  
6.**Context API** : Creating global state accessible across components without prop drilling.  
7.**Conditional Rendering** : Displaying elements conditionally based on the componentâ€™s state or props.

## (context API/local storage):
1.**Context API** : Used for global state management to store and share data across components without needing to pass props manually. For example, the ProductContext provides setCart and setWishList functions, making it easier to manage cart and wishlist data across multiple components in your project.

2.**Local Storage** : Functions like addToStoreCartList and addToStoreWishList indicate that local storage is being used to persist cart and wishlist items.This enables data persistence, allowing users to retain their cart and wishlist data even after refreshing the page or reopening the site.
